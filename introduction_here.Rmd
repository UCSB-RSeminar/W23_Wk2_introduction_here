```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```
Note how here automatically starts in the folder of R project as mentioned above. 

Instead of setting working directory, we can just use the function here inside read.csv. It is super easy, pretty awesome, and makes the code reproducible on other computers. 
```{r}
awesome_data <- read.csv(here("awesome_data.csv"))
awesome_data
```
Lets delete the words column and then save the new csv also using here().
  - we will also see how to reference folders
```{r}
even_awesomer_data <- awesome_data %>% 
  select(!words)

write.csv(even_awesomer_data, here("data", "even_awesomer_data.csv"))



asdf;lkjhadfs;eafqwio;ades;jklndsaf


```

Ta da!


I don't get what this code is doing.
