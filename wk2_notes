- version number
- date its created
- both machine readable and human readable

---- Merge Conflicts and Branching ----
- merge conflict: if file is big and they're not too far apart it'll show you both
  - otherwise it'll stop and show you both versions and make you deal with it before you can pull and then push
- make a new branch to indicate that I am working on things, making big changes
